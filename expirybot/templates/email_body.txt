Hello!

This is a friendly reminder that your PGP key expires on {friendly_expiry_date}.

fingerprint: {fingerprint}
long key id: {key_id}

Here's the key listed in the MIT public keyserver:

https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=vindex&search={key_id}

== Extend your key expiry date ==

You can extend your key's expiry date and push it to the keyservers.

You don't need to create a new key.

I've written a few short guides with screenshots for different software:

- Enigmail with Thunderbird: https://www.paulfurley.com/extend-pgp-key-expiry-with-enigmail-thunderbird
- GPG Suite (GPG Keychain): https://www.paulfurley.com/extend-pgp-key-expiry-with-gpg-suite-gpg-keychain
- GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG): https://www.paulfurley.com/extend-pgp-key-expiry-with-gpg

(I'm currently working on Mailvelope - any others?)

== Remember to push your updated key to the keyservers ==

Once you've extended the expiry date, don't forget to push your key to the keyservers again so everyone can see the update.

I hope this email has been helpful. If this feels like spam, I'm sorry :(

Kind regards,

Paul
