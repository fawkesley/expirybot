Hi! This email was sent by a friendly robot called Expirybot.

This is a reminder that your PGP key expires on {friendly_expiry_date}.

fingerprint: {fingerprint}
long key id: {key_id}

Here's how the key looks in my keyserver, which is part of the public pool:

## 1. Extend your key expiry date ##

If you're still using the key, you can extend the key's expiry date.

You don't need to create a new key.

We've written a few short guides with screenshots for different software:

* GPG Suite / GPG Keychain (macOS):

* Enigmail (Thunderbird plugin):

* GnuPG (command-line):
  https://www.paulfurley.com/extend-pgp-key-expiry-with-gpg

* Fluidkeys (command-line, works with GnuPG, see disclaimer):
  https://www.fluidkeys.com/docs/extend-your-key-from-gpg/

## 2. Upload your public key to the keyservers ##

Once you've extended the key's expiry, remember to upload it to the keyservers so your contacts can download it.


## 3. Remind your contacts to download your updated key ##

Your contacts will need to download your updated key from the keyservers. Some software does this automatically.

If a contact says your key has expired, it's probably because they haven't got your updated key.


## 4. Opt out if you never want to hear from us again! ##

We hope this email has been helpful. If this feels like spam, we're sorry :(
