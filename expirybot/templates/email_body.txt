Hi! I'm Paul and this email was sent by a friendly robot called Expirybot.

This is a reminder that your PGP key expires on {friendly_expiry_date}.

fingerprint: {fingerprint}
long key id: {key_id}

Here's how to key looks in my keyserver, which is part of the public pool:

## Extend your key expiry date

You can extend your key's expiry date and push it to the keyservers.

You don't need to create a new key.

I've written a few short guides with screenshots for different software:

* GPG Suite (GPG Keychain): https://www.paulfurley.com/extend-pgp-key-expiry-with-gpg-suite-gpg-keychain
* Thunderbird and Enigmail: https://www.paulfurley.com/extend-pgp-key-expiry-with-enigmail-thunderbird
* GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG): https://www.paulfurley.com/extend-pgp-key-expiry-with-gpg


## Remember to push your updated key to the keyservers

Once you've extended the expiry date, don't forget to push your key to the keyservers again so everyone can see the update.


## Monitor the keyservers for your email address

If you'd like to know when new keys are added to the keyservers with your email address, you can do that here:

I hope this email has been helpful. If this feels like spam, I'm sorry :(

Kind regards,

Paul
